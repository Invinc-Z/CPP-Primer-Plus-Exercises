b.
Firstly, the constructor and the destructor of the derived class can not be inherited, 
    so the derived class have to redefine them.
Second, as the base class have the pointer member "brand", thus the derived class have to
    redefine operator=() function against memberwise copy.
Third, the derived class need to redefine Show() to show its member data.
Moreover, friend function can not be inherited.
The others are not redefined as they just use the base class portion in the derived class.

c.
The assignment operator cannot be a virtual function, 
    because assignment requires both the left and right operands to have the same static type, 
    while virtual functions rely on runtime polymorphism; the two are fundamentally conflicting in semantics.
The friend function is not a class member function, and it have no pointer this,
    so operator<<() cannot be virtual.
